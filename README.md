# File Handling and Exception Handling Assignment

This Python program:
1. Reads a file specified by the user.
2. Modifies its contents (in this example, converting all text to uppercase).
3. Saves the modified content to a **new file**.
4. Handles errors gracefully if the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/file-handling-assignment.git
